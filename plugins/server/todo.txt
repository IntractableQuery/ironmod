PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (.../paintball2/ironmod/plugins/server/plugin_server.lua:1348: expected player_num_cache to have a value)
note: if you can't fix this, or want a more solid method, you could just
use "sv players" for this also :)
note: it looks like this ALWAYS happens if you connect to localhost...? probably a speed issue
note: it happens sometimes over lan if you let it keep connecting, then suddenly start the server

remember that clients can reconnect... dunno if this matters for anything

Does timing out generate an SE event? if not, this is bad... thefollowing log bit indicates nothing ever occurred GE-wise (but maybe SE? if so, we need to rm players by number in SE)
