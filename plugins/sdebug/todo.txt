PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (.../paintball2/ironmod/plugins/server/plugin_server.lua:1348: expected player_num_cache to have a value)
note: if you can't fix this, or want a more solid method, you could just
use "sv players" for this also :)
note: it looks like this ALWAYS happens if you connect to localhost...? probably a speed issue
note: it happens sometimes over lan if you let it keep connecting, then suddenly start the server

remember that clients can reconnect... dunno if this matters for anything
